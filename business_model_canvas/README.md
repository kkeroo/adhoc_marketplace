# Business Model Canvas
The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management tool used to develop and document a business model.
The canvas consists of nine building blocks that describe different aspects of a company's value proposition, customer segments, revenue streams, key activities, key resources, key partnerships, customer relationships, cost structure, and channels.
These building blocks make it easy for stakeholders to understand and visualize the relationships between the different components of the business model.

## Ad-hoc marketplace
### Selling point
A decentralized ad hoc P2P marketplace dapp, offers a unique value proposition in the crowded e-commerce marketplace industry. Unlike traditional centralized marketplaces, It offers increased privacy, security, and transparency, by leveraging blockchain technology, geofencing tools, and IPFS for storing additional information about listings. This ensures that users can buy and sell goods and services at private events, with only authorized users having access to the listings. Additionally, it offers a more affordable and efficient way for users to conduct transactions, with lower fees and faster processing times than traditional payment gateways. These unique features offer a compelling business value proposition, making the ad-hoc P2P marketplace an attractive alternative to existing centralized e-commerce platforms.

### User onboarding
For sellers, the onboarding process could be designed to be as simple as possible, requiring only a few steps to create a new account, upload their listings, and set prices. Sellers could be offered an easy-to-use interface that guides them through the process, with features such as image uploading, inventory tracking, and pricing recommendations. For buyers, the onboarding process could be even simpler, with minimal registration requirements and the ability to browse listings and purchase products with ease.
