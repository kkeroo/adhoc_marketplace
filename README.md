# Ad-hoc marketplace

A decentralized marketplace is a platform where buyers and sellers can directly connect with each other and engage in transactions without the need for intermediaries. The marketplace can be built using SSI technology, which allows users to control their own identity and personal data through the use of decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs).The use of smart contracts enables automated and secure transactions without the need for a centralized authority to facilitate the process.
